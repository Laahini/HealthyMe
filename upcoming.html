        <h3>SHOP</h3>
        <h5>HealthyMe plans on forming a shop feature for you to buy Pepper the pig new outfits and characters. In order to create an incentive
          for users to complete their tracx everyday and stay motivated, this plan awards them coinz that can be stored in their bank. With
          these coinz, users can buy new outfits for Pepper like AstroPepper and Doctor Pepper. They can also unlock two other characters, Ron
          and Lily, who also each have their own unique outfits and accessories. We hope that this future category will improve user experience
          and satisfaction along with aligning to our mission.

          Goal-keeping is very important to a healthy lifestyle and with our tracx program, it is easy to achieve your goals.
          Our meals tracx will track whether you have had your meals everyday, helping with those who struggle with a stable eating schedule.
          Our workout tracx will track how long you have completed an exercise/workout along with the amount of times you have worked out
          in a week according to your set standard. Finally, our tasks tracx will allow you to keep track of how long you have been doing
          a task along with whether the task is not completed, in progress or completed.</h5>
